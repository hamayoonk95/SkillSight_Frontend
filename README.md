# SkillSight Frontend

## Overview

The SkillSight frontend provides a dynamic and responsive user interface for interacting with the SkillSight platform. It communicates with the .NET backend to fetch and display data, allowing users to explore tech job trends, skill gaps, and much more.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (Preferably the latest LTS version)
- Angular CLI (To install, run `npm install -g @angular/cli`)

## Running the Angular Frontend

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the frontend directory:
   `cd skillsight_frontend`

3. Install dependencies with npm:
   `npm install`

4. Start the Angular development server:
   `ng serve`

5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200` to view the application.

## Configuration

- Ensure the backend API URL is correctly set in the environment files (e.g., `src/environments/environment.ts` for development). This should match the URL where your .NET backend is running.
